GFuncPy Documentation
=====================

GFuncPy is a flexible and intuitive library for numerical analysis and plotting â€” perfect for research, teaching, or just exploring math in a hands-on way. It represents functions in discrete form using :math:`x` and :math:`y` values, enabling direct computation and analysis without fuss.

Here's a quick taste of how simple and expressive it can be:

.. code-block:: python

    from gfuncpy import Identity

    x = Identity([0, 2])

    (x**2 - 2).root()


This snippet finds the root of :math:`x^2 - 2` over the interval :math:`[0, 2]`, yielding :math:`\sqrt{2} \approx 1.4142135\ldots`. Want to see what else it can do? Head to the *Usage* page below for more examples and walkthroughs.
