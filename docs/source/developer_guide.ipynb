    "## Dynamic Math Function Dispatch\n",
    "\n",
    "All univariate Numpy math functions (sin, cos, tan, exp, log, sqrt, etc.) are supported automatically, as GFuncPy uses Python's module-level `__getattr__` to catch calls like `gfuncpy.sin`. If the function exists in NumPy, it creates a wrapper that applies it to the grid values. No manual function definitions needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you define a custom function in GFuncPy with the same name as a NumPy function (e.g., `maximum`, `minimum`), you must explicitly import it in `__init__.py`. This prevents the dynamic dispatch mechanism from interfering and ensures your function is used instead of NumPy's version."

To avoid confusion or bugs, call them via the module (e.g., `gfuncpy.max`) if you want to use them with the built-in `max` and `min`."
