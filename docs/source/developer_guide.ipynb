    "\n",
    "### Dynamic Math Function Dispatch\n",
    "\n",
    "All univariate Numpy math functions (sin, cos, tan, exp, log, sqrt, etc.) are supported automatically, as GFuncPy uses Python's module-level `__getattr__` to catch calls like `gfuncpy.sin`. If the function exists in NumPy, it creates a wrapper that applies it to the grid values. No manual function definitions needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you define a custom function in GFuncPy with the same name as a NumPy function (e.g., `maximum`, `minimum`), you must explicitly import it in `__init__.py`. This prevents the dynamic dispatch mechanism from interfering and ensures your function is used instead of NumPy's version.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "Call any NumPy math function from `gfuncpy` on a `GridFunction` object, e.g. `gfuncpy.sin(x)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `max` and `min` Naming Issue\n",
    "\n",
    "The functions `max` and `min` in GFuncPy overwrite the names of Python's built-in `max` and `min`. Use these with caution, especially in code that also relies on the built-in versions. To avoid confusion or bugs, call them via the module (e.g., `gfuncpy.max`) if you want to use them with the built-in `max` and `min`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Release Management Tip\n",
    "\n",
    "Before creating a new git tag for this project, always update the release number in both `docs/source/conf.py` and `pyproject.toml` to match the new version."
